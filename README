GUB -- Grand Unified Builder

WHAT IS GUB

Grand Unified Builder (GUB) is the mini packaging system that we developed for
building LilyPond binaries. It cross-compiles several packages and assembles
them into a single package. At the moment it supports the following target
platforms

darwin-x86
   tar.bz2 file for Darwin 8 (MacOS 10.4)/x86

mingw
   mingw executable for Windows32

linux-x86
   shar archive for Linux/x86

linux-64
   shar archive for Linux/x86_64

linux-ppc
   shar archive for Linux/PowerPC

freebsd-x86
   shar archive for FreeBSD 4/x86

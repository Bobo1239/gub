WHAT IS GUB
***********

Grand Unified Builder (GUB) is the mini packaging system that we
developed for building LilyPond binaries.  It cross-compiles several
packages and assembles them into a single package.  At the moment it
supports the following target platforms

darwin-ppc
   tar.bz2 file for Darwin 7 (MacOS 10.3)/PowerPC

darwin-x86
   tar.bz2 file for Darwin 8 (MacOS 10.4)/x86

mingw
   mingw executable for Windows32

linux-x86
   shar archive for Linux/x86

linux-64
   shar archive for Linux/x86_64

linux-ppc
   shar archive for Linux/PowerPC

freebsd-x86
   shar archive for FreeBSD 4/x86

cygwin
   .tar.bz2 packages for Cygwin/Windows32 

arm
   shar archive for Linux/ARM (largely untested)

debian
   .deb package for Debian (Linux/x86) (largely untested)



ACQUIRING
*********

The Darcs (www.darcs.net) repository is at 

  http://lilypond.org/vc/gub.darcs/
  http://lilypond.org/vc/gub-stable.darcs/

Where the latter is the last version that has been tested extensively.

You can get the GUB builder by doing 

  darcs get [repository]

for example,

  darcs get http://lilypond.org/vc/gub-stable.darcs/



INSTALLING
**********

* You need 

  - about 9 GB of free space (for all platforms.)

  - A standard unix development environment with GCC and G++
  GNU Make

  - Python 2.4

* Prepare build environment

  make -f <package>.make bootstrap

  use mingit.make for building the MinGW version of Git.


* Build everything 

  make -f <package>.make all

this should leave installers and documentation in

  uploads/

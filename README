WHAT IS GUB
***********

Grand Unified Builder (GUB) is the mini packaging system that we
developed for building LilyPond binaries.  It cross-compiles several
packages and assembles them into a single package.  At the moment it
supports the following target platforms

darwin
   darwin 7 (MacOS 10.3) for PowerPC

mingw
   mingw executable for  windows32

linux
   shar archive for Linux/x86

freebsd
   shar archive for FreeBSD/x86

arm
   shar archive for Linux/ARM (largely untested)

debian
   .deb package for Debian (Linux/x86) (largely untested)

cygwin
   .tar.bz2 packages for Cygwin/Windows32 (largely untested)

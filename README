WHAT IS GUB
***********

Grand Unified Builder (GUB) is the mini packaging system that we
developed for building LilyPond binaries.  It cross-compiles several
packages and assembles them into a single package.  At the moment it
supports the following target platforms

darwin-ppc
   tar.bz2 file for Darwin 7 (MacOS 10.3)/PowerPC

darwin-x86
   tar.bz2 file for Darwin 8 (MacOS 10.4)/x86

mingw
   mingw executable for Windows32

linux-x86
   shar archive for Linux/x86

linux-64
   shar archive for Linux/x86_64

linux-ppc
   shar archive for Linux/PowerPC

freebsd-x86
   shar archive for FreeBSD 4/x86

cygwin
   .tar.bz2 packages for Cygwin/Windows32 

arm
   shar archive for Linux/ARM (largely untested)

debian
   .deb package for Debian (Linux/x86) (largely untested)

  make -f <package>.make bootstrap

  use mingit.make for building the MinGW version of Git.


* Build everything 

  make -f <package>.make all

this should leave installers and documentation in

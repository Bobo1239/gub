* Remove duplication of directory layout.  gub/settings should be only
  place, layout is partly duplicated in bin/* and test-lily/* and *.make.
  Make gub/settings print layout for use in sh/make.

* Document and make easier to add new platform

    -3. gub/settings.py
    -2. gub/config_cache.py
    -1. gub/installer.py
     0. lilypond.make
     1. toevoegen aan platforms in makefile
     2. toevoegen aan platform lijst, die in test-lily/upload wordt gebruikt.

* Add diff option: 561096638b3718af86d61570ac63bafa5c4a99f8

* Robustification against ^C, esp. in in repository.download ()

* Softcode stages.

* move Scons, Bjam recipes to gub lib.

* code cygwin installer as alternative build spec.

* code .deb installer as alternative build spec.

* look at other installer-builders -> build spec?

* Split build recipes into Basic (configure??; make; make install),
  AutoTools

* Automagically do:  # # FIXME libtool too olds for autotool packages.

* move autotools patching to autogen/prepare_configure stage.

* fix all instances of makeflags () and compile/install

* move wrap_pkg_config from libgphoto2 to target/build spec (note
  configure: PATH setting?)

* Bootstrap whole toolchain from source on more platforms (freebsd)?

* Fix configure/make command env var settings (grep FIXME)

 @subst_method
 def CFLAGS(self):
    return 'bla'

or

 def init(self):
   self.CFLAGS='bla'   ? see noweb, no go?

* Packages file with download and update facility, like
  cyg-apt.

LOWER PRIORITY

* do not package emtpy subpackages (doc, devel)

- replace os. calls with os.context wrapper ones (make a real
  dry-run to quick-test all .py scripts?)

- better name for gubb.py

- name for gub-tester (test-repo, repo-builder?)

- Split gub/*py into packager, builder, platform

- Explode inheritance, and use membership in GUP

- move patches upstream, eg.

  * libpng

  * python x-compile.

  * cygwin GCC

  * zlib

- update packages:

  * Gnome 2.16

- strip lily specific stuff from installer.py 

- Bugfixes:

- junk Makefile, create python based driver.

- prerequisites: curl, gcc, libc-dev
  + [lilypond: autoconf (for automake),
    	       bison (for flex),
	       g++ (for python),
	       texinfo (for gettext),
	       libncurses-dev (for texinfo),

	       libexpat-dev (for git),
	       libjpeg-dev (for netpbm),

	       libx11-dev (for netpbm),
	       svn (for ghostscript),
	       python-gdbm (for gub: gub/gup.py) this means, btw, that gub
	        does not run with python from local; it lacks gdbm]

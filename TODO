* update platform packages to use get_cross_build_dependencies
  - darwin
  - debian?
  - mipsel?
  - linux-arm-...

  DONE
  - cygwin
  - linux
  - mingw
  - freebsd

* Split build recipe's into Basic (configure??; make; make install),
  AutoTools; move Scons, Bjam recipes to gub lib.  Softcode stages,
  move autotools patching to autogen/prepare_configure stage.

* move makeflags () feature to buildspec.

* Bootstrap whole toolchain from source on more platforms (freebsd)

* Much less verbosity, write oslog.system () to log file.  (Verbosity
  levels?)

* Install cross toolchain packages in target/local? 

LOWER PRIORITY

- better name for gubb.py

- rename mipsel to debian-mipsel.py (and other debian-based platforms)

- Split gub/*py into packager, builder, platform

- Explode inheritance, and use membership in GUP

- move patches upstream, eg.

  * libpng

  * python x-compile.

  * cygwin GCC

  * zlib

- update packages:

  * Gnome 2.16

- strip lily specific stuff from installer.py 

- Bugfixes:

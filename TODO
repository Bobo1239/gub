* Split build recipe's into Basic (configure??; make; make install),
  AutoTools; move Scons, Bjam recipes to gub lib.  Softcode stages,
  move autotools patching to autogen/prepare_configure stage.

* move makeflags () feature to buildspec.

* Bootstrap whole toolchain from source on more platforms (freebsd)

* Install cross toolchain packages in target/local?

* move and merge cross.Gcc, cross.Binutils into cross/gcc, cross/binutils.

LOWER PRIORITY

- better name for gubb.py

- Split gub/*py into packager, builder, platform

- Explode inheritance, and use membership in GUP

- move patches upstream, eg.

  * libpng

  * python x-compile.

  * cygwin GCC

  * zlib

- update packages:

  * Gnome 2.16

- strip lily specific stuff from installer.py 

- Bugfixes:

- junk Makefile, create python based driver.

- prerequisites: curl, gcc, libc-dev

* Add diff option: 561096638b3718af86d61570ac63bafa5c4a99f8

* Make downloaded repositories easier, something like
    downloads/lilypond.git/.git  # lilypond.git usable with git commands
    downloads/ghostscript-trunk-HEAD.svn/.svn
    downloads/ghostscript-trunk-7882.svn/.svn

* Softcode stages.

* move Scons, Bjam recipes to gub lib.

* code cygwin installer as alternative build spec.

* code .deb installer as alternative build spec.

* look at other installer-builders -> build spec?

* Split build recipes into Basic (configure??; make; make install),
  AutoTools

* move autotools patching to autogen/prepare_configure stage.

* move makeflags () feature to buildspec.

* Bootstrap whole toolchain from source on more platforms (freebsd)?

* Fix configure/make command env var settings (grep FIXME)

LOWER PRIORITY

- replace os. calls with os.context wrapper ones (make a real
  dry-run to quick-test all .py scripts?)

- better name for gubb.py

- name for gub-tester (test-repo, repo-builder?)

- Split gub/*py into packager, builder, platform

- Explode inheritance, and use membership in GUP

- move patches upstream, eg.

  * libpng

  * python x-compile.

  * cygwin GCC

  * zlib

- update packages:

  * Gnome 2.16

- strip lily specific stuff from installer.py 

- Bugfixes:

- junk Makefile, create python based driver.

- prerequisites: curl, gcc, libc-dev

# I'm not sure about the globals QTDIR and QTOPIADIR, or if they're even
# needed. On the same issue, I'm not sure what the best place for all the
# Qtopia Core related files is. For now, I've just put the libraries in
# ${libdir}, the includes in ${includedir} etc. Other possibilities are
# to sandbox everything (e.g., in /usr/local/Trolltech or /opt/Qtopia oslt),
# or to put libraries in /usr/lib/qtopia (or /usr/lib/qt4) etc. As said,
# I'm fine with this, but I'm also fine with another solution.

# set QTDIR and QTOPIADIR globally (change QTOPIA dir to QTDIR?)
# This should be the default for other packages:
# export QTDIR = "${STAGING_DIR}/${HOST_SYS}/qt4"
# export QTOPIADIR = "${STAGING_DIR}/${HOST_SYS}/qtopia"

# Qmake gets confused by environment variables, as it builds both HOST
# and TARGET objects. The correct compiler settings come from the mkspec
# and are set with the OE_QMAKE_ variables

# This stuff could also be done by inheriting qmake, but I didn't want to
# bother with the qmake separation from the Qtopia configure. This separation
# is probably nothing more than a patch on the configure and setting some
# environment variables to use our own qmake/moc/uic, but that's something
# to figure out later.

# We might want to package all the libraries separately, so you can really
# fine-tune what to install. This is e.g. done in qt4-x11-free_4.1.2.bb.
# What should these packages be called? I'm tempted to call them the same
# as in qt4 version, as the API is supposed to be compatible, e.g.
# libqtcore4 and libqtgui4. This will however conflict if you have QT and
# Qtopia, but this is something you don't want anyway, I guess.
# Another solution is making virtual/libqtfoo4, and DEPENDing on that one
# and let both the PACKAGES in QT and Qtopia PROVIDE these. The packages
# themselves could then be called libqtopiafoo4.
# I'll postpone this discussion by not making separate Qtopia packages.

# Also, I don't package the plugins and translations atm, I don't use them
# and I don't feel like thinking about a sensible separation.

# The default included fonts are around 75MB and consist of a number of
# FreeType-renderable fonts as well as QPF (Qtopia Prerendered Fonts).
# As FreeType is generally slow on embedded platforms, and 75MB is
# quite huge, we downsize the fonts dir in the do_install. I've decided
# to include only the QPF (Helvetica and Fixed), amounting to 500KB. This
# also results in tremendously faster application startup time.
# You might want to package the fonts separately, or include all fonts in
# a separate package.

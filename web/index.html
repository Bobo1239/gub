<h1>GUB -- Grand Unified Builder</h1>

<h2>WHAT IS GUB</h2>

Grand Unified Builder
(GUB, <a href="http://lilypond.org/gub">http://lilypond.org/gub</a>)
is a mini source-based distribution and packaging system originally
developed for building LilyPond binaries.  It cross-compiles several
packages and assembles them into a single package.  At the moment it
supports the following target platforms

<pre>
darwin-ppc
   tar.bz2 file for Darwin 7 (MacOS 10.3)/PowerPC

darwin-x86
   tar.bz2 file for Darwin 8 (MacOS 10.4)/x86

mingw
   mingw executable for Windows32

linux-x86
   shar archive for Linux/x86

linux-64
   shar archive for Linux/x86_64

linux-ppc
   shar archive for Linux/PowerPC

freebsd-x86
   shar archive for FreeBSD 4/x86

freebsd-64
   shar archive for FreeBSD 6/x86_64

cygwin
   .tar.bz2 packages for Cygwin/Windows32 

arm
   shar archive for Linux/ARM (largely untested)

debian
   shar archive for Debian (largely untested)

<h2>INSTALLING</h2>

<pre>
* You need 

  - about 9 GB of free space (for all platforms.)

  - standard unix shell utilities: cat, cp, install, mv, rm, sed, ...

  - a standard unix development environment with GCC and G++

  - Python 2.4

  - Perl

* Try

  bin/gub --help

  make help

Examples

  * Prepare a cross build environment

      bin/gub darwin-x86::cross/gcc

  * Build LilyPond master branch for your platform

      bin/gub lilypond
      bin/gib --branch=lilypond=git.sv.gnu.org--lilypond.git-master lilypond

    this leaves an installer in uploads/

  * Build all LilyPond installers

      make lilypond
 
    this should leave installers and documentation in uploads/

  * Build OpenOffice for Windows:

      # svn co svn://svn.gnome.org/svn/ooo-build/trunk
      # ./configure ...; make
      export OOO_TOOLS_DIR=/fresh/build/ooo300-m9/solver/300/unxlngx6.pro/bin
      bin/gub mingw::openoffice

</pre>

<h2>HISTORY</h2>

The story starts with a
<a href="http://www.sankey.ws/contact.html">crazy guy</a>with an itch
to <a href="http://www.sankey.ws/gnunt.html">run LilyPond on
Windows</a>.  Not long thereafter
<a href="http://lilypond.org/~janneke/software/cygwin-cross">Cygwin
cross</a>, our first cross build environment is created.

<p>
  Later, this is moved into
  a <a href="http://sourceware.org/ml/cygwin-apps/2002-07/msg00572.html">patch
  set for mknetrel</a>.  Spring 2005: In a bold move a
  <a href="http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/lilypond/installers/windows">set
  of patches for MinGW</a>are created to build LilyPond and all its
  [17] dependencies.
  <!--
      expat fontconfig freetype gettext ghostscript glib gmp guile
      jpeg libiconv libpng libtool lilypad lilypond mingw pango python
      regex zlib
      !-->
  Simultaniously, a cross build environment and installer for
  <a href="http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/lilypond/installers/macos/">MacOSX</a>is created.
</p>

<p>
  Creating a cross build environment is not too difficult, esp. not if
  you know how to use Google.  The problem is that they always break
  and never work on other machines.  GUB starts as an effort to unify
  the Windows and MacOS builders and to make the process somewhat
  dependable and reproducible, i.e.: even more free time for the
  developers (if there is such a thing) as the builds always succeed.
</p>

<p>
  GUB2 adds serialization of all Python build code before execution
  with checksumming.  Lots of packages are added in an effort to
  replace the OpenEmbedded-based build system for the Samco 3G video
  phone at SES, Philips Research Eindhoven.
</p>

<p>
  In <a "http://news.opensuse.org/2008/08/07/announcing-hack-week-iii">Novell's
  Hackweek-iii</a> GUB enters into its Third Life with
  <a href="http://lilypond.org/gub">GUB3</a>, adding cross-platform
  build dependencies and patches for an OpenOffice.org MinGW cross
  build.
